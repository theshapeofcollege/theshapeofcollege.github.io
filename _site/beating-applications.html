      <div class="article-text"><p>My friend recently asked me advice on how to get into a poetry class which is super oversubscribed. Based on my experience sneaking into (and subsequently being super engaged with) oversubscribed classes, here is what I sent back:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>As a base rate, longer writing does favorably. True for SAT essays, job applications, college, etc. Does not imply causation, so make sure you are concise and deliberate. But don’t be afraid to ask for another professor to send a few sentences to back you up. On your end, attach a portfolio of writing or send a thorough justification via email.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem with students in these classes is always engagement. Try to show convincingly that you will be the most engaged and appreciative student.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you happen to have written poetry, even if it’s bad, send him some to show you actually care–if it’s bad that’s even better since you can claim how passionate you are but don’t have enough feedback to improve on your own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Execute your persuasion strategy aggressively. Follow up every 48 hours asking for updates if you haven’t heard back, or to say “I was just thinking about the class and I’m so grateful for the opportunity. Apologies for another email on the pile, but just wanted to say thank you for teaching this class and helping students learn poetry.” Ask for a one on one 20 minute meeting to workshop a poem you just made–so you can more adequately convey your enthusiasm and because you like developing relationship with professor. <strong>Just be super visible and keep pushing until you get three “no”s not just one.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Separately, another friend asked for alternative class recommendations because the lottery didn’t work out. I think that the above still applies, if you really NEED to take the class. Ask to join the waitlist, or even better ask to schedule a meeting.</p>

<p>“Professor, I didn’t make the lottery but taking this class is really important to me. Can we schedule a few minutes to chat? I understand that there is a waitlist process, but just in case I would love to ask you a couple questions for recommended readings that I can self-study to learn the content…I may not have another opportunity as I do this semester to dive into the subject.”</p>

<p>Come the first day until you are kicked out of the room. Getting top-of-mind will at least get you in the following semester, if not immediately when someone drops the class.</p>
